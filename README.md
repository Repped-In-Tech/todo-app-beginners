# Todo App (Prework)
With these collaborative application building learning sessions, you will see how all the JS foundations you learned will come together with even more new knowledge.

This is going to be hard, but it will also be FUN! This is your opportunity to figure out what your learning needs are going to be in the Bootcamp environment as well.

**Here are some questions you might have:**
- Do I need an extra monitor?
- Do I you need to watch instead of coding along and then go back to implement?
- Do I need to review the work BEFORE coming to class so that you have seen it can can come up with good questions before hand?
- Do I need to learn how to speak up and ask questions during learning time?
